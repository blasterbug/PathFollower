\paragraph{}{
    The purpose of this first assignment is to implement the behavior
of a robot to follow a path in a simulated flat. The path is a list of points
the robot should follow to move around the flat.
}

\paragraph{}{
    To do so, I implemented the algorithm \textit{Follow the carrot} using
 Python. This algorithm is presented below and the source code of the program 
 can be read on the appendix \ref{app:pgr}.
