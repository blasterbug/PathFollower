\section{Difficulties and improvements}

\paragraph{Difficulties}{
    The main difficulty faced during the development was the mathematical
 background needed to compute the speeds. Then, the team work was quite chaotic
 because in one hand my team mate is not used to program and in another hand,
 our schedules were busy and it was tough to find appropriate time which it
 finally leads me to work alone.
}

\paragraph{Improvements}{
    There are several ways to improve the program, and in particular, the
 agent itself. The agent I programmed is, more or less, a reactive agent. So,
 if I want to add a behavior to this agent, as a obstacle avoidance strategy, 
 for instance, we should consider implementing a planning strategy or at least 
 a sumption architecture. \newline
 Another track to improve the agent could be another planning strategy. We can
 imagine that the agent before (or while it is reaching the first points) scans
 the path and detect the loops. Then when it arrives to this part of the path,
 it can use his sensors to detect if it worth it or not to skip the loop rather
 than following it.
